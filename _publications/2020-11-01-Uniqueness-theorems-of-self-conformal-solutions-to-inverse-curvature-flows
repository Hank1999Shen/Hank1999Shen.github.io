excerpt: 'It is known from the literature that round spheres are the only closed homothetic self-similar solutions to the inverse mean curvature flow and parabolic curvature flows by degree âˆ’1 homogeneous functions of principal curvatures in the Euclidean space.

In this article, we prove that the round sphere is rigid in a stronger sense: under some natural conditions such as star-shapedness, round spheres are the only closed solutions to the above-mentioned flows which evolve by diffeomorphisms generated by conformal Killing fields.'
