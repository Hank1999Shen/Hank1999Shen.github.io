Abstract: It is known from the literature that round spheres are the only closed homothetic self-similar solutions to the inverse mean curvature flow and parabolic curvature flows by degree -1 homogeneous functions of principal curvatures in the Euclidean space.
In this article, we prove that the round sphere is rigid in a stronger sense: under some natural conditions such as star-shapedness, round spheres are the only closed solutions to the above-mentioned flows which evolve by diffeomorphisms generated by conformal Killing fields.
