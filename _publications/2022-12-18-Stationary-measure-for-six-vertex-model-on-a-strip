We study the stochastic six-vertex model on a strip $$\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}^2: 0\leq y\leq x\leq y+N\right\}$$ with two open boundaries. We develop a `matrix product ansatz' method to solve for its stationary measure, based on the compatibility of three types of local moves of any down-right path. The stationary measure on a horizontal path turns out to be a tilting of the stationary measure of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with two open boundaries. Similar to open ASEP, the statistics of this tilted stationary measure as the number of sites $N\rightarrow\infty$ (with the bulk and boundary parameters fixed) also exhibit a phase diagram, which is a tilting of the phase diagram of open ASEP. We study the limit of mean particle density as an example.
