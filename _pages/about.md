I am a fourth year graduate student at Columbia University, supervised by both Professor Mu-Tao Wang and Professor Elena Giorgi.

My research interests are differential gemeomtry, partial differential equation, general relativity and so on. I am particualarly attracted by Black Hole which is the most fasinating object that exists in our spacetime!
