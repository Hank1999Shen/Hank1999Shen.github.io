I am a fourth year PhD candidate at Columbia University, supervised by [Professor Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin/). I was an undergraduate student in Peking University.


More about me
======

My research interests mainly lie in integrable probability and KPZ universality, with a particular focus on interacting particle systems, polymer models and their stationary measures.

So far, my appeared works are about stationary measures for the open asymmetric simple exclusion process and stationary measures for integrable polymers and six-vertex models on a strip. See my [PUBLICATIONS LIST](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/publications/).

For the talks I gave, see my [TALKS LIST](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/talks/).
