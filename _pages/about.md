🧑‍🎓 I am a fourth year graduate student at Columbia University, supervised by both [Professor Mu-Tao Wang](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~mtwang/) and [Professor Elena Giorgi](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~egiorgi/).

✨ My research interests are differential gemeomtry, partial differential equation, general relativity and so on. I am particualarly attracted by Black Hole which is the most fasinating object that exists in our spacetime!

📃 So far, my appeared works are about uniqueness of a certain flow soliton, positively curved manifolds with boundary, wave equations on extremal Blackhole background and rigidity/isotopy of maps betwen positively curved manifolds. See my publications list.

🏃 I also enjoy walking and a little running, escpecially walks in Manhattan, Hong Kong, Beijing or other big cities.
