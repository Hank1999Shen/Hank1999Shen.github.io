I am a third year PhD candidate at Columbia University, supervised by [Professor Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin/). I was an undergraduate student at Peking University.


More about me
======

My research interests mainly lie in random partitions, random matrices, and their connections with number theory and representation theory.

So far, my appeared works are about stationary measures for the open asymmetric simple exclusion process and for integrable polymer models and six-vertex models on a strip. See my [PUBLICATIONS LIST](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/publications/).

For the talks I gave, see my [TALKS LIST](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/talks/).
