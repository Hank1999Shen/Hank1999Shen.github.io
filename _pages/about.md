🧑‍🎓 I am a fourth year graduate student at Columbia University, supervised by both [Professor Mu-Tao Wang](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~mtwang/) and [Professor Elena Giorgi](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~egiorgi/).

✨ My research interests are differential gemeomtry, partial differential equation, general relativity and so on. I am particualarly attracted by Black Hole which is the most fasinating object that exists in our spacetime!

📃 So far, my appeared works are about uniqueness of a certain flow soliton, positively curved manifolds with boundary, wave equations on extremal Blackhole background and rigidity/isotopy of maps betwen positively curved manifolds. See my [publications list](https://jingbowanmath.github.io/publications/).

🙇‍♂️ Right now, I am focusing on/studying the following topics: Stability of Blackholes, GCM construction (generally covariant modulated) introduce by Klainerman-Szeftel, positive scalar curvature (both minimal surface and Dirac operator approach) and so on. I am very willing to discuss and learn!

🧑‍🏫 For seminars and talks, I co-organized two seminars in the past two semesters: one about [Scalar Curvature and Topology](https://math.columbia.edu/~axu/seminars/scalar-curvature-seminar-post/), another one about [dihedral rigidity](http://math.columbia.edu/~ypharry/seminar/dihedral-rigidity.html). (I will keep this list updated.) Besides giving talks in these two student seminars, I also gave several survey talks about wave equations and Blackhole existence, see my [talk lists](https://jingbowanmath.github.io/talks/).

🏃 I also enjoy walking and a little running, escpecially walks in Manhattan, Hong Kong, Beijing or other big cities.
