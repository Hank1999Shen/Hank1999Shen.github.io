I am a third year PhD candidate at Columbia University, supervised by [Professor Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin/). I was an undergraduate student at Peking University.


More about me
======

My research interests mainly lie in random partitions, random matrices, and their connections with number theory and representation theory.

So far, my appeared works are about non-archimedean random matrices. See my [publications list](https://Hank1999Shen.github.io/publications/).

For the talks I gave, see my [TALKS LIST](https://Hank1999Shen.github.io/talks/).
