I am a fourth year PhD candidate at Columbia University, supervised by [Professor Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin/) and Roger Van Peski (https://www.math.columbia.edu/~rv2549/). I was an undergraduate student at Peking University.

More about me
======

My research mainly lies in p-adic random matrices with connections to number theory, (Hecke algebra and spherical functions, Sawin-Wood moment method, L-functions, etc.). Beside from that, I am also interested in discrete probability, discrete geometry and Fourier analysis. See my [publications list](https://Hank1999Shen.github.io/publications/).

For the talks I gave, see my [TALKS LIST](https://Hank1999Shen.github.io/talks/).
