🧑‍🎓 I am a third year graduate student at Columbia University, supervised by [Professor Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin/). I was an undergraduate student at Peking University.

===
✨ My research interests mainly lie in random partitions, random matrices, and their connections with number theory and representation theory.

📃 So far, my appeared works are about non-archimedean random matrices. See my [publications list](https://Hank1999Shen.github.io/publications/).
