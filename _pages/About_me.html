🧑‍🎓 I am a fourth year graduate student at Columbia University, supervised by [Professor Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin/). I was an undergraduate student in Peking University.

===
✨ My research interests mainly lie in KPZ universality and integrable probability, with a particular focus on interacting particle systems, directed polymer models and their stationary measures.

===
📃 So far, my appeared works are about stationary measures for the open asymmetric simple exclusion process and stationary measures for integrable polymers and (higher spin) six-vertex models on a strip. See my [publications list](https://ZongruiYang1.github.io/publications/).
