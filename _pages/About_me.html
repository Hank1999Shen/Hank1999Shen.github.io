🧑‍🎓 I am a fourth year graduate student at Columbia University, supervised by [Professor Ivan Corwin](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~corwin/) and Roger Van Peski (https://www.math.columbia.edu/~rv2549/). I was an undergraduate student at Peking University.

===
✨ My research mainly lies in p-adic random matrices with connections to number theory (representation theory and symmetric functions, Sawin-Wood moment method, L-functions, etc.). Beside from that, I am also interested in discrete probability, discrete geometry and Fourier analysis.
