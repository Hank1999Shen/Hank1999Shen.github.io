We present two methods to study the stationary measures of integrable systems with two open boundaries. The first method is based on Askey-Wilson signed measures, which is illustrated for the open asymmetric simple exclusion process and the six-vertex model on a strip. The second method is based on two-layer Gibbs measures and is illustrated for the geometric last-passage percolation and log-gamma polymer on a strip. This talk is based on two works: arXiv:2307.06574 with Yizao Wang and Jacek Wesolowski and arXiv:2306.05983 with Guillaume Barraquand and Ivan Corwin.
