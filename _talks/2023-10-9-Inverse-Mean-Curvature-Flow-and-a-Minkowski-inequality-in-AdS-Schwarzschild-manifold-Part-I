In this talk, we'll discuss a paper by Brendle-Hung-Wang that applies a monotonicity formula of inverse mean curvature flow to prove a Minkowski inequality in AdS-Schwarzschild manifolds. Despite the lack of full convergence in this context (IMCF on Asymptotically hyperbolic manifold), we establish a roundedness estimate that helps estimate the lower bound of a monotone quantity along the flow. Besides IMCF, Professor Brendle's geometric inequality and a sharp Sobolev inequality on the standard sphere are key components of the proof.
