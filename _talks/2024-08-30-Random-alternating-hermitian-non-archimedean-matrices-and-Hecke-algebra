Random non-archimedean matrices play an important role in Cohen-Lenstra heuristics, whose singular numbers provide information for the distribution of ideal class groups for quadratic extension and Tate-Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves. In this talk, I will provide our result on the distribution of singular numbers for random alternating and Hermitian non-archimedean matrices, based on our new application of Hecke algebra.
