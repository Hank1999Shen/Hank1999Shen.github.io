We give the basic ingredients for Stern’s Bochner formula and apply this formula to harmonic maps $M^3\rightarrow \mathbb{S}^1$ where $M$ is a compact three-manifold with or without boundary. This gives a beautiful inequality relating the average Euler characteristics of harmonic map’s level sets and the scalar curvature of $M$.
