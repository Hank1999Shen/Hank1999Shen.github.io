We introduce the Askey–Wilson signed measures as a new tool for studying the stationary measure of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). As applications of this technique, we access several asymptotics of open ASEP: the density profile, limit fluctuations, large deviations, open KPZ fixed-point limit, half-line ASEP limit, and open ASEP with a light particle. Based on joint works with Zhipeng Liu, Dominik Schmid, Yizao Wang and Jacek Wesolowski.
