In this reading seminar talk, the speaker will present Hamilton’s Maximum Principle for Ricci flow and discuss applications for convergence of Ricci flow under certain positive curvature conditions. Then, as a comparison, the speaker will present a version of Bony’s strict maximum principle for degenerate elliptic equations and discuss its application on rigidity results (where we change the previous positive curvature conditions to non-negative curvature conditions). If time permits, the speaker will present and discuss some results where a version of Hamilton’s Maximum Principle or Bony’s strict maximum principle was applied.
