Hawking’s theorem on the topology of black holes asserts that cross sections of the event horizon in 4-dimensional asymptotically ﬂat stationary black hole spacetimes obeying the dominant energy condition are topologically 2-spheres. Geometrically and very roughly, this is analogous to the topological restriction of a stable minimal surface in positively curved 4-manifold. In this reading seminar talk, the speaker is going to talk about Galloway and Schoen’s generalization of Hawking’s theorem to any dimensional Spacetime satisfying the dominant energy condition, asserting that outer apparent horizon is Yamabe positive, except some very special cases.
