In this talk, we will present a new method for studying the stationary measure of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) in the shock region. We introduce a family of multi-dimensional Askey-Wilson signed measures and then describe the joint generating function of the open ASEP stationary measure in terms of integrations with respect to these Askey-Wilson signed measures. As an application, we offer a rigorous derivation of the density profile and limit fluctuations of the open ASEP in the shock region, confirming the existing physics postulations. This is a joint work with Yizao Wang and Jacek Wesolowski.
