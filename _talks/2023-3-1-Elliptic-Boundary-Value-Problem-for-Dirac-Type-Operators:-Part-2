Last time, we defined the differential operator on the boundary associated to the given Dirac type operator using the information of the symbols. Recall that such associated boundary operator is a self-adjoint elliptic first order operator defined on a closed manifold (the boundary), so we can make use of its spectrum (L^2 decomposition of sections defined on the boundary) to investigate what kind of boundary condition is natural for the Dirac type operator. Statements will be given and the ideas of the proof will be sketched, and some important examples will be discussed.
